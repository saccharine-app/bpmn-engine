# **Laravel BPMN Engine**

![bpmn-js screenshot](assets/bpmn-js-screenshot.png)

A lightweight, native PHP workflow orchestrator and visual designer for Laravel. This package allows you to model complex business processes visually using BPMN 2.0 and execute them as durable, stateful background jobs—**without any external Java dependencies** (like Camunda or Zeebe).

It bridges the gap between visual business diagrams and real-world execution by combining **bpmn-js** (for modeling) and **durable-workflow** (for resilient, suspendable background execution).

***Status: v0.3.3-alpha. This package is actively being developed. The core execution engine, token tracking, and manual intervention layers are operational, but it is not yet recommended for production environments.***

## **Key Features**

> * **No Heavy Infrastructure:** Runs entirely on your existing Laravel queue system (database, Redis, SQS, etc.).
> * **Durable Execution:** Workflows are resilient. If a server crashes or restarts mid-process, the engine resumes exactly where it left off.
> * **Embedded Visual Designer:** A beautiful, responsive drag-and-drop designer powered by bpmn-js is built right into your Laravel app.
> * **Event-Driven Architecture:** Natively listen to Laravel Events to trigger workflows automatically using BPMN Message Start Events.
> * **Advanced Routing & Scope:** Full support for Parallel Gateways (AND splits/joins), Inline Sub-Processes, and Call Activities (reusable child processes).
> * **Human-in-the-Loop:** Pause execution indefinitely to wait for external human input (signals), then resume automatically.
> * **State Projection:** Separates background coroutines from UI tracking using isolated relational workflow_tokens, enabling real-time dashboards with zero parallel race conditions.

## **Technical Dependencies**

> * **PHP 8.3+**
> * **Illuminate Support (^12.0 || ^13.0):** Native integration with the Laravel framework ecosystem.
> * **Symfony Expression Language (^7.0):** Used for evaluating sandbox-safe expressions in conditional routing.
> * **Durable Workflow (^1.0):** The robust PHP coroutine framework that provides suspendable workflow engines and queue orchestration.
> * **bpmn-js:** The frontend interactive modeling library, bundled natively via Vite.

## **Documentation**

> * [**Usage Guide**](docs/usage-guide.md): Learn how to design workflows, scaffold activities, use element templates, and implement advanced nodes like Sub-Processes and Boundary Events.
> * [**Architecture & Under the Hood**](docs/architecture.md): Explore the engine's design, including the XML parser, the Strategy Pattern node handlers, and deterministic token tracking.

## **Installation**

### **1. Require the Package**

For local development, link the package to a host application by adding a path repository to your host's composer.json:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "../bpmn-engine",
        "options": {
            "symlink": true
        }
    }
],
```

Then require the package:

```bash
composer require "saccharine-app/bpmn-engine" "@dev"
```

### **2. Install and Initialize**

The package provides an installation command to publish configurations, frontend assets, migrations, and run the database setup.

```bash
php artisan bpmn:install
```

## **Quickstart: The Interactive Demo**

You can instantly scaffold an "Order Processing" workflow to see the engine in action:

```bash
php artisan bpmn:demo
```

This command generates a demo trigger and activity, registers them in your config, and seeds your database with a complete BPMN diagram. Navigate to /bpmn/workflows in your browser to view the generated diagram, and follow the terminal instructions to dispatch the event and watch the background worker execute the logic.

## **Acknowledgments**

This package would not be possible without the incredible work of the open-source community:

> * **bpmn-js** by bpmn.io / Camunda: The gold standard for web-based BPMN 2.0 visualization.
> * **durable-workflow**: The elegant coroutine orchestration layer that makes suspendable, durable PHP processes a reality.
> * Symfony & Laravel: For providing the ultimate foundation of modern enterprise PHP development.
